        <dt>Leg Press</dt>
        <dd>A strength training machine used to target the muscles of the lower body. The user pushes a weighted platform away from them using their legs while seated, which primarily works the quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, and calves.</dd>

        <dt>Chest Press</dt>
        <dd>A resistance exercise performed on a machine or with free weights, targeting the pectoral muscles of the chest. The user presses weights away from their chest while lying on a bench or seated, which helps build upper body strength.</dd>

        <dt>Lat Pulldown</dt>
        <dd>A machine exercise designed to strengthen the upper back and latissimus dorsi muscles. The user pulls a weighted bar down towards their chest while seated, engaging the back muscles and improving upper body strength.</dd>

        <dt>Seated Rows</dt>
        <dd>A strength training exercise performed on a machine where the user pulls a weighted handle towards their torso while seated. This exercise targets the back muscles, including the lats, rhomboids, and traps, as well as the biceps.</dd>

        <dt>Shoulder Press</dt>
        <dd>A resistance exercise that targets the deltoid muscles of the shoulders. Performed either standing or seated, the user presses weights upward from shoulder height, which helps build shoulder strength and stability.</dd>
